A diary and analyitics app for coffee. 

Very much a WIP.

  - bean
  - grind size
  - method
  - brew time including stages (e.g. bloom, pouring phases for pour over)
  - water temperature
  - tasting notes & location on coffee tasting compass
  - rating /5
  - etc.

- Creating methods, recipes, etc.

- Adding beans, roasters, etc.

- Adding grinders (relates to grind size)

- Follow users, star methods, etc.
